ITEM.longdesc = "Tushonka is a common name of canned, stewed meat produced in the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. \nThe irony is that the idea originally came to Russia in a form of World War II aid transports from the United States. \nSince then, various kinds of tushonkas have become a primary means of long-time meat preservation, used both by the civilian population and as a standard-issue Red Army food ration. \nDespite their long expiry date, tushonkas are known for their high nutrition value (mostly owing to high fat content) and a relatively good taste."
