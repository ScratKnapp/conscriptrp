ITEM.longdesc = "The IMI Desert Eagle is a semi-automatic handgun notable for chambering the largest centerfire cartridge of any magazine fed, self-loading pistol. It has a unique design with a triangular barrel and large muzzle.\nThe Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated mechanism normally found in rifles, as opposed to the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols.\nThe advantage of the gas operation is that it allows the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs.\nThus it allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by magnum revolvers.\n\nAmmo: .50AE\nMagazine Capacity: 7"
