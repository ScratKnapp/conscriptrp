ITEM.longdesc = "Mutated, swollen eye of a flesh has a number of strange characteristics, the most interesting and potentially useful of which is the ability to repair even severe damage sustained to the organ. The specifics of this process are hitherto unknown, although the discovery of the mechanism behind it would most certainly revolutionize modern medicine by providing cures for many diseases. You can play a part in speeding up the progress of science and save the lives of innocent people by selling eyes of fleshes to the scientists."
