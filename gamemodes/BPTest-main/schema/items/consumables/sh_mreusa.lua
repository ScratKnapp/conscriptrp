One MRE can be used as one meal. The packaging of an MRE is designed to withstand rough conditions and exposure to the elements. Contains one course along with a variety of other food and drink items. While it can be eaten cold, it usually tastes much better when heated up with the included flameless ration heater (FRH, a water-activated exothermic reaction device that emits heat)."
