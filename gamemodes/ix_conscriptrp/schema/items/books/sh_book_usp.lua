<font color='white'>Congratulations on your purchase of the</font> USP MATCH-GRADE <font color='white'>handgun in</font> STAINLESS STEEL<font color='white'>!
You are now a part of the Heckler & Koch family; refer to the guidelines below for a brief summary of the weapon system and how to operate it safely.

The USP Match is chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum and comes standard with an 18-round magazine.
It is a double-action/single-action autoloading semi-automatic pistol with a decocking lever.
The match-grade trigger allows for a shooter to deliver precise shots in rapid succession, assisted by the barrel weight affixed to the frame of the firearm.
The compensator, while hindering its concealability, reduces the vertical climb of the muzzle substantially.
The pistol is equipped with a manual safety which must be toggled off to allow the hammer and trigger to move.

To load the firearm, first insert a magazine into the well of the handle.
It will lock into place once fully secured; ensure that the muzzle is pointed in a safe direction at all times.
The slide may be manually racked back or engaged with the slide release button in order to chamber a round from the magazine. 
It is now ready to fire. Disengaging the safety will allow the gun to fire, automatically chambering a new round with each detonation of the trigger.

TIP: The decocking lever is used to reset the hammer, vastly increasing the travel-time of the trigger by bringing it into double-action.
This can be used as an additional safety, however the slide will automatically cock the hammer with each shot afterwards.</font>
