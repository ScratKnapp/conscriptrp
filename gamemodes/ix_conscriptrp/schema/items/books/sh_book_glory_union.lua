Dear Reader, if you are reading this book, it is most likely that you now stand in City 17. 
I've decided to create this book for your benefit, so you could learn more about our city, and how to get the most joy out of it.
First, I'll start by; What is the Universal Union? And is it here for a good reason?

The Universal Union, also known as the Combine, a large empire, travelling through time. This empire has reached many forms of planets and worlds
to use them but for return guaranteed protection. Some would say the society has only extinct since their arrival, but many good things require sacrifices.
The Universal Union reform the worlds they are occupied on to fit their needs. Bringing the Citadel is an example of such need.

I'd like to focus more on the civilisation than the UU in this paragraph. Your rights are our rights, each citizen is important for us. The Universal Union tries
to improve equality between citizens. Of course, we have loyalist tiers, but these are rewards. Think of a Loyalist as a "Worker of the Month", if you were his manager
you would probably award them, ranging from a higher salary to different benefits. The Universal Union adapts this system to improve the citizens' 
conditions. Therefore we reward our citizens with tiers which grants them special benefits.

I'd like to explain about the Civil Workers Union/Medical Union, why is it beneficial, and why you should consider joining it. First, it is a great responsibility to
join the Civil Union. One's point of view is that the workers simply do their job because of the salary they receive, but that is not correct. Each person working at their position
does it because of their will, imagine if we didn't co-operate as a society, we wouldn't have doctors to take care of ill citizens; who would sell food, and equipment for citizens?
That is the reason the Workers take that responsibility, because they care for the society. Their hard effort is awarded with rewards such as extra rations and better living conditions.

Here, I'd like to finally address the final issue I've encountered in my whole service. Many complaints have reached me, about our Metro Police Force. I'd like to first say, we're all humans
we all make mistakes, and if an officer commits to such a mistake, please address it, if you don't, we won't be able to improve. The Metro Police are a protection force, they're here to protect you and the
civilisation, from the dangers of the outside. The Police Force have no intention of oppressing the citizens of our city. The Police Force is simply a police force.
Many can now refer to some of the various re-educations that have occurred within the city, please, think for a second, what would happen, if we didn't not only uphold,
but properly enforce the laws of the city?

I myself, once arrived out of a train, introduced to a new place, I lost all close to me, but I didn't let it bring me down. I was once a citizen like you, and I had someone who cared for me.
Therefore, I want to be the one who cares for you, because if we don't help each other, who will?

I'd like to end this book with a question to you, Reader, do you care about the society?
