Let us imagine society, before the Liberation, as a car without a driver.

You are standing on the high street of your hometown. Maybe you grew up in a city, maybe you grew up in a
small village. It doesn't truly matter because you can see the central point where the roads met and people
walked each day, going about their lives.

It is a cold day, the final days of winter, and you can see your breath spiral upwards and mingle with the
chalky pale sky; the day is overcast but the air itself is still and there is very little wind.

You stand there waiting for your friends to pick you up. They arrive in a car and you get in the passenger seat.

There is no driver. The car takes off by itself. The weather above begins to take a turn for the worse.

The dispossed and vunerable cling to the bumper of society as it hurtles full kilter down a highway in the night,
headlights off, tires locked by heavy rain. As a part of this society, you are inside the car, so are your friends
and family, no one is driving; the wheel lists lazily right and left freely.

You start to gain speed and you begin to notice the speedometer tick up and up, never ceasing, never stopping. You
laugh with your friends and drink. You drink and poison yourself, full in the knowledge that this way of life cannot
last forever. The dispossed and suffering rattle at the back window of the car. It's all too much now and the backseat
seems to be growing smaller - you feel the air inside thin. Your friend takes a knife to another friend's neck,
screaming about 'saving himself'. There is no more air, you cannot breathe. The back window is knocked in by force,
shards of glass pepper your face and all you feel is pain.

The car is knocked off the highway. You wake up.

You leave the hospital clutching a leaflet on depression and loss. A cigarette burns between your fingers as you wait in the cold, the pale day chills and stings your fresh stitches.

You get back in the car and begin the cycle again.
