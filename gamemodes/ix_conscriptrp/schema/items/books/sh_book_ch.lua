Once upon a time, in a dark dark city, lived a lonesome child.

The child, bearing the rags that were not even it's own, sat down every night and gazed up at the shrouded sky.
Tiny speckles of light often seemed to peek through the dark veil and the child felt fascinated by them, feeling a familiar attraction.

One night, the child sat down as per usual and spotted something high up in the sky. It was a white bird. It shone light onto every dark corner of the city. The bird shone so brilliantly, that the child had long since stood up without noticing it. The child's misty eyes cleared, as it tried to grasp the bird within it's tiny palm. But the bird was just too far away. The child couldn't bear it, as it saw the bird flying away.

Desperately trying to catch up, the child ran and pleaded with the bird in desperate cries: "Please little bird! Don't go away!"

But the bird didn't stop and before the child even noticed, it had found itself within the grassy outside of the city. In bewilderment, the child looked all around, spinning on the spot, not brave enough to take one step. It breathed the fresh air and it saw the stars decorating the firmament, which glistened like the prettiest of diamonds.

The child's eyes grew bright, as it came back to it's senses. The white bird, shining ever so brilliantly in this darkest of nights, had descended onto a nearby hill, hovering a just few feet above.

The child hastily ran up the hill, tumbling, falling yet crawling the remaining distance. As it came close to the white bird, the child's body trembled.

"Little bird, please take me with you!" the child asked with a weak voice, having spent all it's breath.

"But child, you have no wings." the white bird answered. It's voice was a crystalline clear and it contained no malevolence.

The child looked at the white bird with longing. It truly wished to freely soar the skies, just like this pretty little bird.

The two of them spent some time and the bird told the child stories of the outside world.

"Child, it is time for you to return to the city. Your absence will be noticed." the white bird said.

"But little bird, the city is such a dark place, I don't want to lose your light." the child, with tears forming in it's eyes, stubbornly refused to leave.

"Child, you have a light of yours within the eyes, that shines even brighter than the many many stars. As long as your eyes continue to gaze up at the sky, I will always find you again." the white bird kindly reassured.

"Will you come back tomorrow, little bird?" the child asked.

"Yes and I will tell you many more stories." the white bird answered in a warm tone.

The following nights, the child kept gazing at the sky and as promised, the white bird returned, leading the child outside the city. They talked a lot and the child listened intently and gleefully at the many stories of the outside world.

But on one night, as the child sat at it's usual spot, with a smile on it's face, it spotted the white bird flying in pretty arc and giddily stood up. But what happened next was out of the child's expectations. The child never considered how the dark city despised the light and at this moment, the bird soared far too low, tempting the city to swallow it.

The child heard a bang and the white bird, which gracefully soared the skies, dropped down towards the looming shadow of the city, it's light quickly fading.

The child's face filled with dread, it's body lost all power and, with a thud, the child fell to it's knees. It's eyes fixated on the spot, where the bird fell from, waiting for the moment in which the light would resurface. But the shadows never returned the bird.

The child's heart was aching, it's bright eyes, once more became misty and shrouded in dark. Before long, it returned to it's home.

The following nights, the child didn't sit at it's usual spot. It didn't gaze upon the sky.

As the child lived, it couldn't help but remember the stories of the outside. Everytime the child tried to turn it's thoughts around, it instead thought of the bird, more and more. The joy of the past was not so easily forgotten, no matter how much the child tried. 

One night, the child pulled together all it's courage and followed the path towards the outside of the city. The child knew by now how to leave without the guidance of the bird.

The child arrived at the hilltop. As tears in it's eyes glittered, the child looked up once more at the star sprankled sky, silently pleading for the bird to return to him.

As if listening to it's heart, a bright glow emanated above the child. The child spotted the light, that like one of the stars shone and descended slowly. The child watched with a heavily beating heart, as the white light dropped down in front of him.

It was a white shining feather, that landed gently on the child's palms.

"I was finally able to find you, child." the feather talked in a bright familiar voice.

"Little bird?!?" the child exclaimed in surprise, eyeing the bright feather in it's cupped hands, careful not to crush it.

"Child, grasp this feather. It will help you to fly." the voice from the feather said.

"But, little bird...what about you?" the child asked with a trembling voice.

"For me it is too late now, I can no longer fly. But you still can, I'll just need to give you a little push."

The child looked at the feather with worry on it's face.

"Don't worry, child. You will find your way. The world is vast, there is so much to see and there are many more people with light in their eyes, who are gazing at the sky at this very moment." the voice faded with every word and by the end, it was completely gone.

The feather started to glow more intensely, merging itself with the child.

The child was overcome by the warmth of the feather and felt the chains, that shackled him to the ground disappear, as it's body began to glow and take off the ground.

The child happily soared through the skies, it was like a dream come true. Everything in his mind faded away, as the child lost itself in the joy, until a sudden sparkle crossed it's eyes. 

The child stopped midair, gazing towards the light. A smile formed on the child's face as it sped off towards the distant stars.
