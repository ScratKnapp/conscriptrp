<font color='blue' size='5'>Chapter I - Cult Emblems</font>

After thorough research into the so called "Lamp Cult" we've come across several symbols with varying meanings. In this first chapter we'll be having a look at some of these symbols and giving theories about their meaning.

The most commonly seen symbol throughout our exploration into the strange cult. It seems to depict the very lamp found throughout most populated regions of Earth. It is commonly found above altars and was used during their crusade in City 17.

A lesser known emblem believed to symbolize the members of the cult. The symbol bears a similarity to the first symbol but without the lower half. This symbol was only seen once in our expeditions and might be obsolete.

Yet another of the possibly obsolete symbols, this one was found in a few of the books, which made figuring out its meaning a challenge. We came down to the conclusion that it represents "Non-believers" due to context clues and its similarity to the prior emblem.

A somewhat rarely seen emblem which resembles that of a bald male, most theorize this to be connected to the obscure myth of a bald man with extremely pale skin, said to have been spotted wandering in various cities across the globe. The pale man is referenced in some of the Line books, and yet his exact role in the cult is unknown.

An emblem we've yet to spot for ourselves, so obscure in its origins that we couldn't even confirm its legitimacy. What we could gather from the witness report was that the symbol represents a secondary lamp, which seems contradictory to the cult's purpose. We tried to contact the witness for further interview but have yet to recieve a response.

Perhaps the most obscure symbol to date, this emblem believed to depict a lava lamp is only seen once in any of the books (Line 2), and offers no explanation to its meaning. Our best theory at the moment is that it represents yet another lamp, but we have no concrete evidence to back this up. 

<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/J10fULs.png"

A newly found symbol, clearly depicting a light bulb. Its never featured in any of the books so our researchers seem torn on its legitimacy and until further information is found we'll consider it a fake.






<font color='blue' size='5'>Chapter II - Line Books</font>

In our research we found several books with similar names, we took the time to write some of the pages into our jornal. It should be noted that Line 1 has seemingly been lost in history to our great annoyance.


Line 2

"Having explained to us about its origin, he continued: He was driven away from his kind that day and found himself in a place he would describe as a dark abyss. He told us that they wandered this plane for what seemed like weeks until he found an anomaly in the constant emptiness. An opening to a world he could not quite explain to us, or perhaps we were just not able to understand."

Line 4

"After having understood that the beings inhabiting this world posessed some intellect, our lord did not see it fit to massacre them as he and the second one had planned. Our lord confronted the other with demands of using these mortal beings for another purpose, though our lord did not give us many details we hypothesize this as the reason for the other's absence."

Line 7

"Our lord described them as a once magnificent species before their alteration, they had lost all of their legs in the process, they were hideous floating monstrosities with arms protruding from their heads. Our lord expressed pity for their state and promised to return if he ever found a solution to repair their former glory. For now they remain the servants of the false god."

Line 9

"Having grown tired of the mundane nature of observing the lives of his subjects, our lord wandered back into the void in search of a more interesting world to explore. After many days of walking through the ever-shifting plane of the abyss our lord came across a peculiar opening which stood out from the rest he had seen, upon attempting to pass through the opening our lord however found himself unable, as if something in there was trying to keep him away. Though initially frustrated our lord accepted this and began his travel back to his conquered world."

Line 10

"Our lord described the next as a fortunate coincidence, he had been travelling the abyss only for the usual silence to be broken by an ear-piercing sound eminating from nearby. He described what he found to us as best as he could: A humanoid with extremely pale skin albeit wounded for an unknown reason. As our lord questioned the being about its origin, he disappeared with another loud sound being blasted throughout the empty realm. Our lord said he could not find the human for a few days after that."

Line 11

"Having heard the same noise echo from the abyss our lord quickly made his way to the source, the pale man this time seemed relatively unharmed. Our lord quickly interrogated him about his origin to which he quickly found the man unable to reply. Frustrated by the inability to communicate with the strange creature our lord waited for the man to disappear once more and to re-appear, our lord was shocked to see him re-appear in front of his "Eyes" only a minute later. Our lord chose not to disclose too much of what happened in fear of complicating his future plans, but he told us this marked his first breach into our world."

Line 12

"Our lord had manifested a vessel in his image, it had appeared in one of the districts of City 17 where most had ignored it. The first children of the lamp including I would soon find the lamp however, and this marked the birth of the Children of the Lamp."

Line 16

"At this time we had already earned a negative stigma around the locals, they had titled us the Lamp Cult and decided we were nothing but lunatics seeking peace of mind by worshipping household objects, if they only knew the truth... I sometimes question why we allow the mad to join our cause, some of which don't even know the origins of our lord. Still, I have faith that our lord Clexo has a plan for us all."

Lastly we felt the need to inform you that research indicates the well known "Line 32" is nothing but a propaganda book written by a lone cult member. From the looks of it there were many undiscovered Line books that are yet to be found, these line books may not be authentic, but they give us a clear view into the mind of a mostly sane cult member.



<font color='blue' size='5'>Chapter III - The pale one</font>
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/yx4tTKg.png"

Throughout the years of combine rule many have reported sightings of a pale man, the very first sightings describe the pale man acting confused and frantic, where as more recent sightings claim to have seen him walking around without a set goal or writing on the walls. However, sightings of the pale man have lessened in recent years.
Any and all attempts of reporting the pale man to the authorities have resulted in no results, whether this is due to lack of belief or some government conspiracy is unknown.




<font color='blue' size='5'>Chapter IV - Known cult members</font>

Throughout the years of cult activity some notable figures in the cult have come to public knowledge:

Neil Nlaw

An old man leading the cult scene in City 45, from what the public have been told he was at one point on the Combine's "be on lookout" list. Neil was detained and killed when he walked into the plaza dressed in black robes, whilst being pursued by zombies.

Sikke Van Der Veer

Another known cult member who died in City 16, not much is known about him before his death in that city other then his position in the Civil Medical Union.

Quway Snenjar

A lesser known cult member from City 24, from our research within the cult we found that he was but a recruit and considered bad at his job. His current whereabouts are unknown.

CP:25.FLASH-02

On October 31st 2016 the local Metropolice Force pulled a prank on the residents of City 24 where they pretended an undercover cult member serving the Civil Protection had killed the administrator, during our research we found some chilling evidence that the prank was anything but fake. Flash-02 or Elizabeth Milton was in fact an undercover cultist who infiltrated the Civil Protection forces and assassinated the admnistrator on live broadcast. Truly, it is alarming to know our protectors are lying to us.

Joe Stone

A believed to be cult leader in the industrial district of City 17, he was a primarily non-violent leader who distributed the "Line 32" propaganda book and assisted the rebels at times.

Jeremie

Reports from one of our researchers noted several notes written by one Jeremie, our researcher described them as scouting reports written for his group. The researcher notes that many portions of the note were unintelligible or scribbled over, the notes also contained mentions of his superior named Wilfred and a boy named Seth.

Theresa Nlaw

Reports from a former initiate mention an elderly woman who was acting as the leader of a cultist group in City 17 at a time, the surname is an obvious connection to deceased cultist Neil Nlaw. According to the initiate she disappeared without a trace.

Seth Lampp

The former initiate which informed us of Theresa also mentioned another initiate by the name of Seth, he supposedly had a close relationship with Theresa before disappearing without a trace. Interestingly the reports made by Jeremie mentioned a "Naive boy" named Seth.

Wilfred Lampp

Supposedly one of the last remaining elders of the lamp cult, evidence suggests that Wilfred Lampp actually declared himself an elder when he picked up the specially crafted helmet of his deceased master. This information was given to us by a group who would prefer to remain anonymous. Additionally notes made by Jeremie mentioned a Wilfred as his superior.


<font color='blue' size='5'>Chapter V - Closing statement</font>
We reach the end of our research for now, from our understanding this group was founded by a group of citizens who found a "Talking lamp", from there on they recruited many members most of which were mentally unfit citizens who had nowhere else to go. And now afer many years the cult has almost faded into obscurity aside from a few loyal members. We will update this journal if anything remarkable should happen.
