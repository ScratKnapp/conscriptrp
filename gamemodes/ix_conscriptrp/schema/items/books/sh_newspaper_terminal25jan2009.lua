<font color='black' size='6'>Opinion Piece: Education and the Restriction of Religious Freedom</font>
<font color='red' size='4'>Written by Emily Amber.</font>

There has been a great deal of talk about the quashing of rights under the Combine. Perhaps the most heated topics at the moment are religious rights and the education of our children in the Combine Civil Schools. Some parents are understandably frustrated, saddened or angered by the antireligious education their children are being given, but this is misguided. They are scared that their religion will die out- As if such an outcome is undesirable. They are unable to shake the religious indoctrination that they themselves received. 

Let us be truthful with ourselves: Were we wise enough to have taken these measures ourselves, many of the problems the Combine is now dedicated to solving for us would not exist.

If we had been, as a population, scientifically literate and rational, we would not have seen the high levels of pseudoscientific anti-vaccination proponents whose ignorance led to a resurgence in preventable diseases and needless deaths. 

If we had been, as a population, scientifically literate and rational then we would not have been plagued by religious fundamentalists and terrorists. 

If we had been, as a population, scientifically literate and engaged then there would have been no platform for climate change deniers and the Earth would not be in its current terrible state. 

For too long, we have allowed ignorance and superstition to perpetuate itself and plague humanity. The Universal Union that so many people scorn and curse in their ignorance is saving us from ourselves. Through education, we will be set free. 

As a species we had reached our teenage years, intelligent and developed enough to do great things and yet too immature and ignorant to fully grasp the consequences of our actions. With the guidance and loving care of the Combine, humanity will reach adulthood and take its rightful place amongst the stars.
