What to understand from the world is that we are not special. All of us are not unique, we should not be 
categorized by our specialties. I wish I had time to prove this in my life, but unfortunately I must pay for my
sins to the hands of God himself. I have made an exception to this theory though, and that is what I am writing
about today. I'm writing about a man that has gone through hell to get to this book, gone through hell to get to
where I want to be, gone through hell to get to where he wants to go.

On January 21st 1987, a man named Ryan immigrated to the United Nations. Had he not done this, the outcomes of the
world would have changed dramatically. This man I have come to meet, and surprisingly, he seems to not be that bad.
On October 18th 1992, Ryan had already saved around 10 people whilst in service. He was stationed in Saudi Arabia,
despite his hatred for the heat. By the time December 8th 2004 occured, the entire world was dead. But if Ryan did
not exist, the entire world would not only be dead, but would be destroyed. What he has done for us is beyond 
astronomically superior than any human could come remotely close to. If I were to compare him to anything, it would
have to be an Armada, a fleet of warships coming in to destroy whatever gets in their way; these warships are
strategic and slow, though they obliderate anything in their path.

Ryan was born on March 12th, 1955. He was one of my best friends at the time. Ryan was an interesting character, he
seemed to be interested in almost everything. One day he would want to be a firefighter, the next a police man,
the next day a construction worker, and so on. He did alright in school, passed with A's, B's, and some C's. Average
kid he seemed like. That was until his 11th year in school. As a Junior, he felt as if he was.... superior to others.
He also played Football, which in my opinion, made matters worse. He began to take drugs, began to fight people
and hang out with the wrong bunch of people. But on June 7th 1972, he did something unforgettable. Ryan was drunk
at a party he had recently went to, he was with his asshole friends Jake and Neil. The three of them were good
friends for around 3 years, and they all had about the same average grades. Jake held a very strong posture and
had golden hair, probably dyed. He had an amazing physique and seemed like a jockey or something. Neil, not so much.
Neil was a kid that seemed a bit more nerdy; he was into computers and electronics and stuff, but he still hated me
despite us having so many similarities. But on that day, at that party, Jake and Neil got Ryan so drunk, that he could
barely talk. His words would slurr and he would stumble into people over the loud music that would be echoing through
the entire neighborhood. But on that day, Ryan did not go back home for a long time. He was convicted of multiple
counts of Sexual Assault and Rape. Immediately, he was arrested and sent into a holding cell for a few days, when he was
then sent for Juvenial Detention.

I thought this was the end for him, but he changed.

On February 9th 1979, about 7 years later after his incident, he was let out of Juvenial Detention early for good
behavior and for showing he learned his mistakes. It was not a warm welcoming back from anyone, including his family.
His asshole friends began to leave him, worried about their own reputations; his family began to ignore him and
talk to him in a rude manner; people in the neighborhood always kept their children close to them when he was around.
His life was ruined. It seemed like there was no way to redeem himself, but on March 17th 1979, he signed up for the
Military. I thought at first, like other people, 'He'll probably get a gun and shoot himself the minute he is deployed!'
Or perhaps, 'He's gonna fuck the Commanding Officer if she's female!' But to our somewhat surprise, he did not do
anything like this. He wished to be stationed in a place far away, somewhere he could forget his old life and start new.
They originally did not want to do this, as he had no degree in high school, and could be a threat to allies potentially.
He was sent to a special program to ensure that he would fit up-to-par, and he did. Within a few months, Ryan had gone
from nothing to serving in the Military. He hoped it would get the respect for his friends and family back, but
it didn't. They didn't care about him anymore, and he unfortunately knew it. The drugs began to kick back in, despite
the isolation, and he began to go insane I think. I didn't want to really be friends with him at the time anymore,
but I thank God every day that I did stay with him. On January 21th 1987, he was in the United Nations and was 
deployed in Saudi Arabia for a search and locate mission. He was in a group with six men, including him. Three of the
six, he never talked to. But the other two soldiers in his platoon were close to being the best friends he would ever
need. Their names were Mason and Ulner. Mason seemed to be one of the 'tough guys', always overworking his limits and
always thinking he needed to do too much better. He had an excellent physique, until a lot later on. Ulner was a
relaxed guy, to be honest. I'm surprised this guy was in the Military and not on a fishing boat. He was the platoon's
marksman, because he had an excellent shot. He later became a hunter for the rest of his life after what happened. But
these two people helped Ryan so much. About a month later, a letter came to me about Ryan, saying he was wounded in
combat and lost his right leg. A landmine that was defective accidently blew up and took his entire leg with it. The
letter said that he almost died and should have a relative come to see him as soon as possible. I didn't even bother
ask, because his family didn't care anymore, and Ryan knew that too. So I flew over to the United Nations and visited
him. It was so long since I've seen him. He looked happier, despite his leg being gone. He said it was the price for happiness,
which is quite worrying for me.  But he did look better, so I wasn't too worried at the time. About a week later, he
was forcefully deserviced from the Military, and he went back into hell, he told me.

He had no place to stay except for where I lived. His family denied his hospitality and service, and actually did not
care about his leg being lost. I thought that was way too cold. Family should always care even if some people make
mistakes. So, he stayed with me. It was better anyways, to stay with someone he knew. He kept in touch with Mason,
but Ulner, not so much. He lost contact with Ulner about two months after being deserviced, and never lost contact with
Mason until the event happened. I was thinking about getting him a job somewhere far away, get him a decent sized
apartment and let him live his life. He didn't do any of that though. He just sat in his room on his computer either
reading or talking to Mason on occasion. His physique dropped dramatically, and he lost almost all of his muscle. The drugs
didn't stop either. When he ran out of money, he started to ask me for 20 bucks to 'go to the store', or some shit like
that. Then he'd come back with no groceries at all, or would just buy a coke for authenticy. I signed him up for a
drug treatment program, but he only went to two of the meetings because he said 'people looked at him weird'. He went
from hanging out with the 'cool kids' to not even wanting to look at people. Maybe that's why he was okay with shooting
them.

Until about 2004, he did not change. Not until the event.
