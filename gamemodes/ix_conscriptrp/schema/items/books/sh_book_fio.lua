Freedom is often regarded as the necessary and vital oxygen.

The myth of the tortured artist, living on the fringes of society unbound by any of its conventions is powerful and enduring. 
As is the trope of the lovable rogue, who flaunts law and order yet saves the day from the true villains.
The mysterious loner vigilante who lurks in the night, watching for criminals and protecting the weak where the police cannot.

However, closer inspection reveals the truth; boundless freedom is a very poor model for a functioning society. The insistence on freedom is a smokescreen, or perhaps a misapplication of terms. Ask someone whether they want freedom they will agree to this, explain to them that if everyone is free to do absolutely as they please, there will be nothing to stop some sadistic monster from torturing them to death and they will uncomfortably shuffle around and concede somethinga long the lines of; Well, maybe not that much freedom.
But the truth of the matter is that human society actively needs law, control and hierarchical order for it to operate successfully and productively. The human mind does best operating within such an environment and though it always yearns for greater freedom, the understanding that what freedoms we surrendered are garuntees to us that others cannot do something unpleasant to us is the foundation of our safety.

'Freedom', like 'love', is so over-used to cover so many concepts it has hardly any objective meaning.
