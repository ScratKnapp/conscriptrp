Ah, the Request Device, one of the most useful tools for the budding loyalist.
You can buy said device at your local Civil Workers' Union, or a Union approved shop.
You should locate the big red button in the centre of the device, once pressed, you must speak loudly and clearly.
There is a well known format you have to use when reporting with the request device, it goes as follows: Name: CID: Location: Reason:, Civil Protection will otherwise ignore your request
if you fail to use this format. 
Our great leaders, Civil Protection, are always busy, so please do not clog their interfaces up with un-needed requests. Only use the device when you need to.

With that said, I wish you good luck in your future loyalism.
