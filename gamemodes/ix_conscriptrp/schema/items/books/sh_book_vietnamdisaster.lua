The Vietnam war has often been described as a disastrous mistake in American foreign policy and military intervention alike. The war had become unpopular as it drew on and as the south Vietnamese government collapsed shortly after the Paris peace treaty, many felt that the nearly two decade conflict had been a waste of life and money. Vietnam soon entered the consciousness of western society as a military and political blunder that would affect the course of the cold war, however the argument that sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake to begin with and the overall impact of the Vietnam war on the United States may have been overstated.
The Vietnam war was certainly an embarrassment to the United States military might. The perception that America was losing to a technologically and militarily inferior opponent  in the context of the Cold War, was not only an international embarrassment but also appeared to be a potential weakness for the Soviet Union to exploit. If the American military seemed too weak to contain the threat of Communism then it was possible that other countries would defect to the communists and that its opponents would begin to act more aggressively. Indeed, already the perception of the US had shifted enough that Middle Eastern countries felt content ignoring the wishes of the United States even when threatened with military intervention.  It’s bluffs were now all too easy to call in light of the lack of appetite for another military intervention post-Vietnam.  The damage to the United States reputation was thus serious and indelible, but it was not only the opinion of the military that suffered. After portraying themselves as the moral superiors to the communists, the United States was now also seen to be committing atrocities. Agent orange caused genetic damage to many Vietnamese and US soldiers alike who were exposed to it, resulting in deaths and birth defects many years later. The use of napalm on villages and the destruction of crops, along with atrocities such as the My Lai Massacre shocked people throughout the world and damaged Americas international image. Having committed these atrocities to help prop up a corrupt and unpopular south Vietnamese regime  through violence and bloodshed, it was no longer easy for the United States to portray itself as the white knight of freedom and democracy. It gave the communists of the world a stick with which to beat the west and undermined the core of the moral argument against the communists.

Worse still was the damage to the government and military’s reputation back in the United States itself. The American people themselves were arguably keen to avoid another military intervention after Vietnam, refusing to see more American lives wasted in a relatively insignificant country. Thus the possibility of thwarting communist revolutions through direct military intervention was no longer a viable option; The US intervention in the Angolan Civil War, which began the same year as the end of the Vietnam war, could thus only be through covert military supplies and subversive action rather than direct military intervention, while Cuba felt secure in sending troops to aid the communists in Angola despite its close proximity to the United States,  whereas the United States sought to arm UNITA and FNLA covertly.  The American people had seen low level support turn into full blown war in Vietnam and were fearful of this happening elsewhere, and thus the US now had to act against the communists without appearing to do so. As such, Vietnam can be considered a major misstep and disaster for the United States as for many years it tied their hands tighter in regards to foreign policy, restraining them much tighter to the will of the common man . Regardless of the truth of the United States military successes in Vietnam, the perception that the most advanced army in the world had been handily beaten by poorly armed villagers stuck in the American memory.  On the other hand, while the US interventions were on a much smaller scale post-Vietnam and were often covert, there were still also overt if lower profile military interventions throughout the rest of the twentieth century and Cold War.
Aside from the damage to the reputation of the US military, the damage inflicted on the US military itself should not be underestimated. The cost of lost military equipment was high and the loss of experienced soldiers and officers delivered a blow to the United States military, which replaced these men with the poorly trained and motivated conscripts.  Their morale was shattered and they had become defeatist and disorderly, with incidents of insubordination and murder known as ‘fragging’  becoming more and more common, particularly committed by conscripts against unpopular or particularly harsh officers . As the war dragged on and draft calls continued to raise, the morale of the conscripted soldiers and the American people continued to dwindle. 2.1 million Americans went to Vietnam with a peak of over 500 000, hundreds of thousands of these were conscripted through the draft and many of those who had volunteered had only done so in the hopes of finding assignments with lower risks before they could be conscripted.  Many of these conscripted soldiers had taken to drug use and alcoholism to escape from the constant stress of the Vietnam jungles and some outright refused direct orders to enter combat. On the other hand, some of this mutinous behaviour was caused by factors outside of the Vietnam war; refusal of combat by African American soldiers may have been caused by a rise in black nationalism, racial tensions and the civil rights movement in the United States itself.  Whatever the case, the United States military could not even reliably count NVA casualties often inflating them with civilian casualties; it is thought that as many as a third of those who were counted as NVA dead were in fact civilians. Though, some have argued that the civilian casualties rates were not far different from the Civilian casualty rates in Korea and the Second World War, suggesting that it might be the case that the perception of the Vietnam war as being particularly harsh on civilians is inaccurate.  Although the United States attempted to save face with stories of domestic problems undermining the war effort, the so called ‘Vietnam Syndrome’, the truth was simply that the Americans had been strategically outplayed from the very beginning. In spite of all their technological advantages, the United States Military had failed to be flexible and disciplined enough  to contend with the guerrilla tactics of the NVA who had proven adept in quickly adapting their tactics to changing circumstances. 
The economic effect of the Vietnam war must also be considered. The United States spent many billions of dollars propping up and supporting the South Vietnamese military and economy; Throughout the Vietnam war, the cost of the military assistance given to the South Vietnamese army had skyrocketed up to 16 billion US dollars and the economic assistance cost the United States a further 7 billion,  with the scale of economic aid spiking up dramatically once Johnson took over from Kennedy and direct US military intervention was increased. In light of increased spending on social policies by President Johnson, they money spent on the war could have been put to better use domestically. The effect on other communist economics must also be considered; the major communist powers of China and the USSR both sent aid to North Vietnam, whose economy had been completely shattered by the United States. The CIA estimated the Soviets and Chinese to have sent around $3.5 billion, a large sum that could doubtlessly have been better invested within the countries themselves, although some of the aid was provided under credit conditions that might have ultimately been favourable to the communists.  Ultimately, however, the effect of aid on the economics of both the communist countries and the United States was negligible. In fact, the US economy grew throughout most of the Vietnam War and although there was a major recession at the end of the Vietnam war, this was not in any way related to US foreign policy in Vietnam but rather oil embargos. 
The role of the media in shaping the perception of Vietnam cannot be overlooked; the American people saw images of warfare and suffering printed in their newspapers and broadcast to their television screens. People, particularly young students, who were initially unopposed to the war grew to dislike and despise it. By the end of the 1960s, polls were consistently showing that the majority of Americans thought that the war had been a mistake to begin with.  This can be considered in one of two lights; It can either be evidence for the view that Vietnam was a disaster due to the media coverage turning the American people against the war and embarrassing America internationally. Conversely, it could be considered evidence that it was only the media portrayal of Vietnam that made it seem so rather than due to any military failure, feeding into the narrative that the war had not been lost in Vietnam but had rather been lost at home in America. This would depend on whether one considers Vietnam to be a disaster solely for military reasons rather than political reasons or vice versa. Furthermore, it has also been argued by some that the media did not play this role and in fact actively censored some of the more brutal images of the war; Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman argue that the press also covered information in order to present the allies of the United States in a more favourable light, thus reinforcing the perception of America as being morally just in the war and raising morale rather than lowering it.  Furthermore, Chomsky and Herman point out that the United States media maintained a specially crafted narrative that would serve to allow opposers to the war to adopt a counter position without inherently condemning the United States; they claim that the US media would allow for one to accept the view that the North had invaded the South or that the North intended to liberate the south, but that in both cases the North is always the aggressor and the United States always stands in defence of its ally rather than acting aggressively itself.  However, the media depiction of Vietnam did doubtlessly send home graphic images that caused many protests, such as the images of villagers fleeing from napalm. CBS broadcast images of US marines setting fire to the homes of villagers against the wishes of President Johnson, which would not have been done if the media were self-censoring to support a pro-American narrative.  These images fuelled the domestic anti-war movement, in turn pressuring the US government to withdraw its troops and speed up the peace process. This trapped the United States between two poor options; withdrawing would make them appear weak, but refusing to withdraw would inflame the domestic tensions, make the rhetoric about democracy ring hollow and, for its politicians, give the opposing party a stick with which to beat them in the elections. As Ashley Ekins puts it “[it was] a costly quagmire from which the United States could neither withdraw honourably nor achieve decisive victory.” 
A lesser way in which the Vietnam war was a political disaster was in the changes in leadership it caused in the United States. The presidents and the presidential candidates of the United States ultimately had their political fate tied to the fortunes of the Vietnam war. President Lyndon B. Johnson saw his political career ruined by the war; In August 1968, during Phase Three of the Tet Offensive, the approval rating of President Lyndon Johnson plummeted to its low point of 35% . With his approval rating having deteriorated so rapidly, Johnson declined to run for a second term.  The Vietnam war became a controversial topic in the following election and certainly played a large part in deciding it in favour of Nixon. Not only did this shape the politics of the Cold War but it also affected the course of domestic US policies. The effect of the Vietnam war had other far reaching implications. Lyndon B. Johnson had grown apart from Martin Luther King over the Vietnam war and so the Civil Rights movement became increasingly impotent and unable to affect change, overshadowed by the War and sidelined by the government . This can be seen as a disaster as it potentially prevented a further rise in the quality of life of non-white American citizens and hampered the progress of the United States towards equality, thus causing long term social damage to the United States. On the other hand, it can be argued that the Civil Rights movement had been radicalising and Kings more peaceful branch would have lost its momentum regardless of King and Johnson’s disagreements.
The United States had set out to contain communism, fearing that if Vietnam became communist then the countries around it within Indochina would also become communist as was predicted by domino theory. The United States could be seen as having succeeded at this with the Paris Peace Accords, which called for a limited ceasefire, guaranteed that the United States would assist the south if the North invaded again and that the reunification of Vietnam would be done through peaceful means. This treaty would suggest that the United States had been successful in its goal of preventing the North Vietnamese from overrunning the South Vietnamese, and indeed for a time peace was anticipated by some and Kissinger was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize, although Le Duc Tho declined to receive the prize as he believed that Kissinger had violated the terms of the treaty.  After the United States withdrew its troops in accordance with the agreement and in the wake of the 1973 oil shock, the North launched fresh offensive operations against the South. The US Senate had passed a bill that specifically required the President to justify any military intervention to congress, thus preventing the resumption of the bombing campaign and assistance of south Vietnam by Nixon.  Furthermore, the United States reduced their financial aid to the South Vietnamese government despite the financial situation of South Vietnam becoming increasingly fragile due to the economic fallout of the oil price shock.   Without the backing of the United States, the south Vietnamese government collapsed and Vietnam fell to communism, abandoned by the United States who had previously fought so hard to keep it. As such, the United States ultimately failed to prevent the communist takeover of Vietnam and although the predicted domino effect did not occur, this was clearly a disaster for the United States.
In conclusion, the Vietnam war was disastrous for the United States of America and weakened its position in the cold war immensely. Unlike in the Korean War where the United States had been able to ensure a long term armistice, Vietnam fell completely to the communist North Vietnamese and the spread of Communism in Indo-China was thus not contained. Fortunately for the West, the chain reaction predicted by domino theory failed to materialise and the intervention thus seems to have been a waste of resources and life defending against something that would never have occurred to begin with. The United States military performed very poorly against the North Vietnamese and by the time the war had ended, the North Vietnamese had achieved many strategic victories over the United States while United States military discipline had all but collapsed, with soldiers even deliberately avoiding combat with the enemy in so called ‘Search and Avoid’ patrols . This made the United States appear to be weak on the world stage and encouraged the communists to act more brazenly. The United States had also seriously soiled its reputation as a respectable and morally just country due to its atrocities in Vietnam and the corruption of its armed forces in investigating them and, at times, seemingly encouraging them. This shook the American people and resultantly, once once the President had restricted by the war powers act, the military became far more beholden to the will of citizens in regards to foreign policy; Senators who wished to retained their seats would be unlikely to vote in favour of unpopular wars en masse. The term ‘Vietnam Syndrome’ was coined as a conservative political phrase that attempted to explain away the US military defeat as having been the result of domestic problems rather than military failings, and which led to the US people fearing involvement in foreign conflicts for fear of another such disaster. It is clear, however, that this is false; the United States did proceed with other military interventions after Vietnam and while it does seem true that there was a greater degree of caution amongst the American people, it certainly did not lead to the paralysis of the military or to sheepishness on the part of the American government. The exit of United States troops from Vietnam resulted in increased corruption, the collapse of law and order and inevitably led to the destruction of South Vietnam, suggesting that the United States military had at least somewhat succeeded in being a stabilising force for South Vietnam while it had been stationed there despite ultimately failing to ensure the long term existence of South Vietnam.   Overall, the Vietnam war had been severely mishandled militarily, had caused political strife and had humiliated America in the eyes of the rest of the globe, but the stakes were simply not high enough and the United States too powerful for the Vietnam war to have a major impact on the outcome of the cold war.
