<font color='black' size='6'>PLA Terrorists Defeated!</font>
<font color='red' size='4'>Written by Li Kaihui.</font>

Since the end of the Seven Hour War, the Dìqiú jiefàngjun (?????), the "Planetary Liberation Army", or PLA for short, have plagued Sector 7 and beyond. Born from traitorous elements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who refused to stand down and instead began a futile campaign of terrorism and death, the name has terrorised the innocent citizens of Sector 7 for far too long. 

Despite mounting atrocities including murders, bombings of civilians and peaceful Civil Workers, and even on one occasion the kidnapping and killing of a child for the mere crime of having a mother who worked for Civil Protection, unsophisticated minds continued to imbue them with romantic power, giving them dangerous poetic labels as freedom fighters and liberators. 

Fortunately, this reign of terror has ended today. The Planetary Liberation Army, after abducting and torturing administrator Zhang Cao (??), were assaulted by Overwatch forces in their hidden base at the Ertan Dam. 

Overwatch Taskforce Quicksand's mission was a complete success. Veteran Commandos were sent ahead as an insertion team and succeeded in all their objectives. After neutralising multiple PLA Surface-To-Air missile sights and anti-armour equipment, and sabotaging a munitions depot, the insertion team came under assault from multiple PLA controlled BTRs. and multiple rebel snipers. While some of the brave units of insertion team were thus badly injured or killed in combat with the PLA, their reinforcements from the assault force were now able to move in to relieve them and engaged in a protracted battle where they stormed the terrorist strong hold, rescued Administrator Zhang Cao and killed the brutal terrorist kingpin Wang Dongfen (???)


The PLA, previously the most powerful terrorist organisation in East Asia, has been utterly wiped out and captured to the last man. The people of Sector 7, and of Earth, can sleep quietly in their beds tonight secure in the knowledge that the brave soldiers of the Overwatch and our extraterrestrial allies from the Off World Forces stand ready to defend them from even the most insidious of terrorist threats. 

This has come at a terrible cost, however; Although the brave and noble forces of the Union were careful to avoid damage to the Dams structure in the fighting, refraining from using heavy artillery despite the additional hardships upon themselves, the PLA terrorists showed no such restraint. In a desperate attempt to stop the forces of the Overwatch, the cowardly Wang Dongfen ordered that the Dam itself be destroyed. 

As the Overwatch forces had at this point already ascended out of the basin to safety, they took negligible losses and this cowardly strategy only served to delay the inevitable. As a result of the cascading water, however, several coastal towns further down river were flooded resulting in countless deaths. Furthermore, hydroelectric facilities and dams were damaged, resulting in a power outage for the region and widespread flooding destroyed crops, food supplies and railway infrastructure. 

Sector 7s administrator is already moving food and supplies, so graciously provided by our mutual benefactors, to account for this loss and relieve the people affected by this travesty. 

Here at the Terminal Newspaper, we would like to note that our thoughts go out to the brave citizens of Sector 7 who have long since had to ensure the horrors of the PLA, and our thanks go to the dedicated forces of the Overwatch for rescuing us all from this terrorist menace.

<font color='red' size='4'>As broadcast by Viktor Shiva Consulidutius.</font>

Denizens of the Union, delegates of the Civil Worker's Union. I've been baffled lately by the disheartening news that I have received from my sources.

It has been quite a while since we have cast a gloom on the topic of diseases, these times are dire for revolution- A revolution in the frontier of loyalty and unity. We all are required to take a deep dive into the dismal state of our populace. As much as it is despondent for me to take act upon something that we all could've taken our hands upon... It is required for me as it is part of my responsibility, my duty, all for the betterment of our populace's morale. 

Let me strike a point into the hearts of many by stating or reading some letters that I have received from our reputable concerned denizens.

'Dear Administrator Consulidutius,'

"How is it possible that a huge outbreak of diseases had recently concurred, or rather, coincide with the populace these recent days? I do not know your education, let alone your background... I do certainly hope that being part of the Civil Administrator and one of the recent advocates that had joined- will give you the power to answer this riddling question of mine that had affected me and my family lately.

Signed, a reputable member of the Civil Worker's Union."

First of all, I would like to thank you for giving a letter directed towards the general populace's health. This only proves that even the delegates that are so hated by the populace, pointed by the recent reports to me by my sources- continue to care for you, for us, for everyone in this faculty. It is quite heartwarming to prove a point that can change the point of view of those that consolidate their views, stating that the reputable members of the CWU are merely people that want to feed their depraved views and benefit from this through the Union.

Of course, we can think of new ways in the field of medicine and technology with the appearance of our Benefactor's superior technology- but then again we are required not to be dependant on our benefactor's gold and bold society and 'condescending' valuables. If we are to continue such path, we are no longer qualified to live amongst the stars as we have all but wanted to.

Then again, to think of possible counter-attacks and prevention against these diseases is all but up to the projects that the Civil Medical Union will provide and serve for the people of the Union. However, I think rather the contrary that these diseases are all but naturally occuring to these new environments, especially the cold and foggy climate that City Twenty has. If we are to think outside the box, we can only think of a band of disruptors, envoys of those that refuse to observe themselves as they are becoming the monsters we all had hoped to banish from this world.

Shall we entrust ourselves against those that linger beyond our safe limits? Beyond our knowledge? Break the rules of Unity and become suspicious of every single citizen? These questions simply hope to be answered by our Instincts. As we all can recall, Instinct has been our mother ever since we have been an infant, she had nurtured us before we had become an adult homo-sapien, she has been there since our beginning. As we progress towards innovation, Instinct continues to pull us down, refusing to leave its child. One may ask: "But Administrator Consulidutius, wouldn't that be impossible without any modifications to our thinking? Would the Union, or our Benefactors, be able to support our ascendance to the stars?"

Questioning the benefactor's ability to transcend our race to the stars, is almost as the same as questioning our ability to innovate for our future with the help- with the salvation of the Benefactor's golden hand. We can always think of ways to motivate ourselves not to succumb into instinct's prying claws. We have threwn ourselves into the depths- the pits of fear beyond the unknown. If we fear the unknown, how can we ever face the salvation that is out there? Beyond anything that we could imagine? 

I would like to address the great work that our Civil Protection delegates has been doing for the past few years, keeping instinct away from us as we venture towards the stars with the help of our Benefactor.

Then again, we are all human. We think differently, and that is something that I would like to change- that the Civil Administration wants to change- something that our Benefactors would like to be removed. We shall all be uniform to how we think and move, for this is the first step towards salvation and unity.

Glory to the Union. Glory to the Benefactors. Glory... For the Human Kind.
