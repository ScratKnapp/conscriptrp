In my time I have encountered a number of anti-citizens, 'rebels' as they call themselves, and have had the luxury of conversation with several of them. I have attempted to understand their psychology as simply branding it factionalism or tribalism (though it no doubt is tribalism that drives them towards rebellion) is not extensive enough in order to dismiss their arguments. In fact, it is a fallacious way to dismiss an argument. It is at best an argumentum ad lapidem and at worse an argumentum ad hominen, indeed perhaps it's subclass Ergo Decedo, to do so.

Argumentum ad lapidem - dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity
Argumentum ad hominem - the evasion of the actual topic by directing an attack at the opponent.
Ergo decedo - where a critic's affiliation is seen as the underlying reason for the criticism and thus the criticism is dismissed

Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that it is best to create a book that is a sort of compilation of common arguments against the Union and the reasons why these arguments are incorrect and fallacious. Consider it a sort of 'frequently asked questions' book if you will. 

Concordantly, all arguments in this book are those erroneously believed to be pertinent by anti-civil elements and with some fortune and arduous these beliefs will be changed with the publication of these musings.

"The Union has killed people, and thus the Union is bad. Therefore, humanity must resist the Union." Variations may include "The Union killed <insert relative here>"

The argument holds a basis in reality in that, yes, the Union has killed people and continues to do so. However, this does not make the Union inherently bad. Indeed, there is no nation in the history of this world which has not ordered the termination of an individual. The Union may not necessarily do it more frequently either, it may merely be more open about it. Though it is likely that the Union has killed more people than any single human nation in history, one must also remember that upon the Union's invasion there were more people than ever before present than in recorded history and Union dominance over the planet covers far more territory than has ever belonged to any single human nation. Therefore it is a foregone conclusion that more would die even if the same proportion of the population were killed by the Union as were killed during the wars of human history. 

Moreover, attributing all deaths to the Union is itself erroneous. In fact, this is a fallacy of composition. That Civil Protection is composed of people who have, in general, killed at least one other human being does not mean that the entire Union is composed of those who have killed others. 

Further, this argument is a Nirvana Fallacy; it is assuming that because the solution to humanities problem is not perfect that humanity must resist against it. Nothing could be further from the truth, of course.
When it comes to people who note that the Union killed a relative or that they have seen the Union killing a person and from this are concluding that the Union is an evil organisation, one must note that while this is a tragic event and 'sacrifices must be made' is hardly something which will placate them, it is a Anecdotal Fallacy all the same.

Nirvana fallacy - when solutions to problems are rejected because they are not perfect solutions.

Fallacy of composition - assuming that something true of part of a whole must also be true of the whole
Anecdotal fallacy - using a personal experience or an isolated example instead of sound reasoning or compelling evidence.

"The Union is an invader who is occupying human land. The Union rules over Humanity with little regard towards the wishes of Humanity itself. Thus, humanity must revolt and be free of the Union."

This argument is not a fallacious one and may hold some water depending on your view point. However, one must be careful as to what this says. Invasion has been the primary method by which human nations have expanded their territory in history. Indeed, without invasion and subsequent occupation humanity would never have reached the state it is in currently as the many empires of ancient history responsible for spreading knowledge around would never have formed. Some areas of the world might still be living in tribal societies with backwards methods of medicine and life. The Union is just another cog in the machine of history and we should not resist it on the grounds that it is an invader. Rather, benevolent invaders such as the Union should be embraced due to the good that they can provide should they be embraced.
Further, if the Union is occupying human land and humanity was rid of the union then, under this argument, humanity would have to split into small tribes in order to be the only ones controlling their own land as all land everywhere is held by some specific group of people and it would, under the conditions of this argument, be evil to occupy said lands. This argument stems from an in group bias that many humans have towards their own species out of instinct because, of course, in the animal kingdom it is imperative for the survival of the species that humans favour themselves over other species. This instinct requires more thought as we now know that we are not the only sapient species in the multiuniverse and that other species exist and their needs and wants must also be considered along with our own. Ergo, this argument is concordant with a level of factionalism and tribalism that must be fought and dismissed from civilised society for human science to continue its march.
"The Union has some Nazi esque policies that I do not agree with. The Nazis were evil and thus the Union is evil." or "The Union shares some policies with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was evil and thus the Union is evil."

Again, this is a fallacy of composition; It assumes that because some of the Union's policies may be reflective of Nazi policies that the Union is composed entirely of Nazi policies and thus is a Nazi organisation. This is also a false equivalence or an association fallacy, the Union and the Third Reich are not comparable based on only a handful of policies. Concordantly, the fact of a policy having been implemented by the Nazis does not make it a bad policy or vice versa. Whether it is a bad policy should make it a bad policy. For instance, the Nazi Party funded the construction of vast networks of roads called 'Autobahns' and surely nobody is going to argue that the construction of Motorways for ease of transportation of goods and people around a country is evil. This may also invoke Reductio ad Hitlerum.
Indeed, while one can draw parallels of modern events with historic events one should not always pass judgement based on these parallels. It is imperative that we understand that we do not see the whole picture along and that our own views display only a fraction of the picture we seek to pass judgement on. Such parallels are subjective and thus one must be careful not to make the Fallacy of Unwarranted Assumption.

False equivalence - a logical fallacy which describes a situation where there is a logical and apparent equivalence, but when in fact there is none
Association fallacy (guilt by association) - arguing that because two things share a property they are the same.
Reductio ad Hitlerum - comparing an opponent or their argument to Hitler or Nazism in an attempt to associate a position with one that is universally reviled
Unwarranted assumption fallacy - The fallacy of unwarranted assumption is committed when the conclusion of an argument is based on a premise (implicit or explicit) that is false or unwarranted. An assumption is unwarranted when it is false. These premises are usually suppressed or vaguely written. An assumption is also unwarranted when it is true but does not apply in the given context.

Other common fallacies employed by anti-civil individuals include:

Moral high ground fallacy - in which one assumes a "holier-than-thou" attitude or attempts to assume a moral high ground in an attempt to show ones self and ones cause in a positive light to win an argument rather than arguing from factual bases
Example: Arguing that "The Actions of the Union are not morally just while the actions of the Resistance are morally just. Therefore, the Resistance is right." while ignoring that this view point is entirely subjective

Onus probandi - When the burden of proof is shifted from the person who makes the claim, to the person who denies (or questions the claim).
Example: An anti-civil individual arguing that instead of them having to prove their claims that the Union is evil, the loyalists have to disprove this claim instead.

Cherry picking - The act of pointing at individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position
Example: An anti-civil individual making an argument that the old world was better than the new world, ignoring the countless millions of people who were in poverty, homeless or otherwise had awful living conditions

Appeal to emotion - where an argument is made through the manipulation of emotions, rather than the use of valid reasoning. Most commonly it's subclass, appeal to spite, is used. 
Appeal to spite - a specific type of appeal to emotion where an argument is made through exploiting people's bitterness or spite towards an opposing party
Example: An Anti-Civil individual attempting to stir up hatred of the union by bringing up those who have been killed by it, usually while ignoring or hiding the true reason behind their execution or while ignoring that individuals will always die in the case of a war.

Wishful thinking - a specific type of appeal to emotion where a decision is made according to what might be pleasing to imagine, rather than according to evidence or reason
Example: An anti-civil individual attempting an appeal to emotion by portraying the old world in a positive light despite it's true connotations to countless individuals; All things look better in hindsight.

Appeal to nature - wherein judgement is based solely on whether the subject of judgement is 'natural' or 'unnatural'
Example: This is commonly used by anti-civil individuals when arguing against the unions efforts to stop instinct and unlawful reproduction through such precautions as the suppression field. They may argue that stamping out instinct is unnatural and thus shouldn't be done, thus invoking this fallacy.

Argumentum ad antiquitatem - a conclusion supported solely because of it being tradition
Example: Arguing that because the old worlds had systems that were in place for an extended period of time (such as democracy), these systems of inherently right.

Argumentum ad populum - where a proposition is claimed to be true or good solely because many people believe it to be so
Example: "If the Union is good why do so many people think it is evil?" Many still erronoulsy believe that the union is a negative force, and thus many anti-civil individuals will invoke the feelings of the people in order to claim that the Union is bad rather than logical conclusions

Two wrongs make a right - occurs when it is assumed that if one wrong is committed, another wrong will cancel it out.
Example: "A CP killed my family and thus I should rebel against the Union."
