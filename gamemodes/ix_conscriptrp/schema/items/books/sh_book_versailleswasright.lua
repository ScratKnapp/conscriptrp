This essay will focus almost entirely on the Treaty of Versailles as while the other treaties that closed the First World War were important to their respective nations and played a minor role in causing the Second World War, it was the actions of Germany that started the war in Europe and consequently caused the outbreak of the Second World War. As such the question is more whether the treaty of Versailles was the cause of Germany�s actions and in this regard, the seeds of the Second world war were indeed sown in the treaties of the first.
Despite this, the other treaties naturally played a role in causing the second world war; The Treaty of St Germain inflamed tensions in Austria and ultimately resulted in them joining with Germany when the opportunity was provided, increasing Nazi power and ultimately prolonging the war when it started. The treaty of Sevres was a harsh and exceptionally duplicitous treaty that caused chaos in the former Ottoman Empire and resulted in fighting. In this regards one could consider that the seeds of a war were sown in the treaties - however this war in the middle east did not evolve into the Second World War. The Second World War was almost entirely caused by European powers (with the exception of the Asian War that became inevitably intertwined with the European war) and did not result from this treaty. As a result of this chaos and the subsequent Turkish War of the Independence the Treaty of Sevres was never properly implemented and was annulled and replaced. 
Further, these treaties resulted in the establishment of weak new nations with little to establish a cohesive community and sense of belonging. Likewise, they were often politically weak, unstable and divided, to make matters worse, each of these nations way vying for control over the others. Not only did this provide fertile ground for civil strife and not only did it provide ample opportunity for war to break out between these nations, it also meant that they were at the mercy of larger and more powerful neighbours and as such effectively fell into their spheres of influence or were easy to invade once war began. Nazi Germany was ultimately able to bully many of its smaller neighbours into complying with its demands right under the nose of the league of nations.
It has been argued that �virtually all Germans� wanted to free Germany from the restrictions of the peace treaty� to make Germany the greatest power in Europe.�  If this is true, then it would certainly suggest that the seeds of the second world war were a result of the first; The argument would follow that Germany found the treaty to be utterly unacceptable and a second war seemed to be the only way to rectify this issue. However, this is not entirely the case as Germany had already begun to renegotiate terms of the treaty with the allies in the 1920s and the amount of reparations were reduced over time. There was a real sense around Europe that the treaty had been too harsh on the Germans and some were sympathetic to them. 
Graham Darby has argued that the �Treaty of Versailles was neither soft enough to reconcile the Germans, nor harsh enough to cripple them forever; It fell between two stools.�  At a glance this appears to be the most accurate assessment of the treaty of Versailles; It was harsh enough to fuel resentment and place the thoughts of a second war and yet not harsh enough to make such a war an impossibility. In fact, it left the basis of Germany�s position intact. It still had the resources and the economic potential to become a major power again and its large and expanding population ensured that it would not face the same demographic problems that plagued France in spite of the heavy tolls of war. It had lost 13% of her economic capability which while a strong blow was not enough to cripple her and allowed her to retain her position as a major economic power in Europe. 
The argument that the treaty was neither harsh enough nor soft enough is also made by Anthony Adamthwaite who writes that �In truth, the diplomatic disasters of the 1930s flowed logically from the inconclusive nature of the victory of 1918� the preservation of Germany�s political unity and economic potential gave little hope of permanent peace.�  Following this line of argument nothing short of a white peace or the complete destruction of Germany would have prevented the second world war. However, this is not a complete picture of what happened; While the diplomatic disasters of the 1930s may have some roots in the treaties of 1918, the reality is that they were mostly spawned out of the great depression. Moreover, it does not account for the recovery that occurred within Germany during the mid to late 1920s as well as the repeated renegotiations between the various allied countries and the Weimar Government which show that the treaty would probably have been significantly softened overtime had it not been for the Wall Street crash. Ultimately however, this does not change that the seeds of the second world war were planted in the treaties of the first world war even if they could not have resulted into a war without the great depression.
A more lenient view on the treaty finds some support from Glaser, Feldman and Boemeke who write that �the treaty lent itself to future revision and eventually led to an era of temporary stability between 1924 and 1931.�  They suggest that the Treaty itself was not necessarily a bad treaty and that it had been designed in such a way that it could be easily adapted in the future. In their eyes, while there were clauses in the treaty which were poor and ill thought out, the treaty overall was important and could have built a bedrock for peace. It is important to note that the treaty was quickly cobbled together as a result of the war ending earlier than expected and this can excuse some of the more ill conceived clauses in the treaty such as the war guilt cause. However, while the treaty may have lent itself well to renegotiation and while the short time period in which the treaty had to be drawn up may excuse some of its shortcomings, the fact remains that it was a dictated peace that forced insulting terms upon a people who had surrendered rather than to have dragged the war out for as long as they could have. Such a situation was all but certain to end in more bloodshed and violence.
Harold James points out that �recent historians have a milder view of the peace, and rightly point out that the real problem was that the legacy of the war was so painful and costly that any settlement would be a disillusion.�  According to this view of the peace treaties, there was simply no way to make a treaty that would not cause grievances between all parties. It is true to an extent; it would have been political suicide for any allied politician, save for the American Woodrow Wilson, to have advocated for a lighter and more amicable peace and similarly the German people would have accepted no less had they been victorious. The peace between Germany and Russia made the Treaty of Versailles look entirely fair by comparison as it was extremely harsh and resulted in Russia losing much of her valuable farmland. It can be argued that these peace treaties were a symptom of the problem and not it�s cause; the first world war did not end with the total defeat of Germany. There was a real sense among the German people that their army had not been defeated and that they had instead been betrayed by politicians and political duplicity. This feeling was so great that the German negotiators and signatories to the armistice became known as the November Criminals. In this climate, one can easily argue that a lasting peace was unlikely

Perhaps further evidence that the seeds of war were not sown in the treaties of the First World War and that the war was caused by other factors can be seen in the actions of Mussolini�s Italy. Italy was a vital player in the run up to the Second World War. Their actions in Abyssinia and Greece were instrumental in emboldening Hitler by proving the League of Nations toothless as well as providing him with a key ally as they sided with the Nazi�s against the allied powers during the war. Italy had been one of the victors of the First World War and � although not one of the �Big Three� as Orlando of Italy had stormed out of negotiations� had certainly benefitted from this and were considered an important world power. This is shown by them holding a permanent seat on the League of Nations Council. In this regard, one can see that there were many other reasons for the Second World War and that perhaps the real fault lies with fascism and not with the treaties themselves as while these may have been a convenient excuse and cover for the Nazi Party of Germany, fascism promoted war as a glorious endeavour that was crucial to building the power and prestige of a nation � an endeavour that was natural for a nation and its people to engage in. Italy had not been punished by any of the treaties of the First World War and as such its actions cannot be explained in terms of revenge as the actions of Germany can. Thus, it can be argued that the treaties themselves did not provide the basis for the Second World War and it was the rise of fascism, caused by the Great Depression and not by the existence of these treaties, that truly caused the war.
Further, the terms inflicted on Germany as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, for example, were far less severe than those which the Germans had intended to inflict on their enemies (And indeed, had inflicted on Russia in the Treaty of Brest-loisk and had previously inflicted on France after the Franco-Prussian War)

In conclusion, while there is no shortage of evidence that many factors contributed to the start of the Second World War and that the treaties themselves were not a direct cause of the war, these served only to germinate the seeds that had been sown at the end of the First World War. While there were other harsh treaties, the most important treaty was that which dealt with the German Empire. The Treaty of Versailles was a working peace treaty that was in accordance with other treaties of the time. This does not mean it did not have an effect on the German people; The attempt to force a nation with a proud military tradition into a situation where it had a standing force too small to protect its own interests was a grave insult, as was the War Guilt clause which forced them to accept the blame for a war which wasn�t truly their fault to begin with - yet this clause itself did not put the blame fully on Germany, it was merely a clause neccesary to establish the payment of reparations. What was truly wrong was not the treaty itself but the very methods for enforcing this treaty were either abandoned or rendered useless. For example, the League of Nations was shown to be a toothless organisation which relied too heavily upon the support of its members, many of whom could be relied upon to act only in their own interests. In truth, it would have perhaps been wiser to inflict a harsher and more enforced peace upon Germany, or to break it back up into its ancestral states.
