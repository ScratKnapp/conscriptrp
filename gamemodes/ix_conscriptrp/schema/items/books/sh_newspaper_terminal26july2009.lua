<font color='black' size='6'>Terrorists Bomb City 14 Ration Terminals</font>
<font color='red' size='4'>Written by Samantha Chaplin.</font>

In a conniving and brutal move, City 14s six major Ration Distribution Terminals were each destroyed by anticitizen bombs earlier this week. 

The attack was well coordinated and occurred simultaneously, shortly before rations were to be announced. Five Civil Protection Officers and thirteen citizens have been confirmed dead as a result of the bombings.

The Ration Terminals are, particularly for those of us unfortunate enough not to have acquired a long term work placement, a godsend that ensures no human will ever again starve. Such a wanton act of destruction aimed at the lowest members of our society is shameful and must be openly condemned. 

Civil Protection has confirmed that one suspect has been apprehended and they have several major leads that they believe will lead to the capture of the responsible anticitizens before the end of the next week. 

On behalf of all staff of the Terminal newspaper, we extend our heartfelt condolences to the people of City 14 in this troubled time.

<font color='red' size='4'>Written by Wallace Breen.</font>

It has come to my attention that some have lately called me a collaborator, as if such a term were shameful. I ask you, what greater endeavour exists than that of collaboration? In our current unparalleled enterprise, refusal to collaborate is simply a refusal to grow--an insistence on suicide, if you will. 

Did the lungfish refuse to breathe air? It did not. It crept forth boldly while its brethren remained in the blackest ocean abyss, with lidless eyes forever staring at the dark, ignorant and doomed despite their eternal vigilance. Would we model ourselves on the trilobite? Are all the accomplishments of humanity fated to be nothing more than a layer of broken plastic shards thinly strewn across a fossil bed, sandwiched between the Burgess shale and an eons worth of mud? 

In order to be true to our nature, and our destiny, we must aspire to greater things. We have outgrown our cradle. It is futile to cry for mother's milk, when our true sustenance awaits us among the stars. And only the universal union that small minds call 'The Combine' can carry us there. 

Therefore I say, yes, I am a collaborator. We must all collaborate, willingly, eagerly, if we expect to reap the benefits of unification. And reap we shall.
