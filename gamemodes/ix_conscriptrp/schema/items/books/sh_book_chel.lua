<font color='red' size='4'>For Chel.</font>

There was no beginning, there was only Chel, the power of the spirit that was ‘The Chel’ had existed long before time itself, it crafted ALL into being. The Chel crafted time and space all with a quick burst of wind that blew out from its arse. The Chel, was not satisfied with the gust of existence itself so The Chel seperated itself from the realm of time and space he created, and built outside of it Valhalla. Valhalla was built to be perfect, a kingdom larger than time, it floated on beautiful clouds and nebulae. It’s streets paved in Gold, lights made from diamond, pearl structures and green meadows. Tall forests, vast clear oceans. The Chel then crafted Sentinels, to live in Valhalla with it. Of all the Sentinels, four were The Chel’s favorites. Cartour, Korchev, Idemu, and Nignig were the strongest, smartest, and best looking of all the Sentinel males. There were given much privilege and much responsibility over the lands of Valhalla and the beasts that lived within it. They owned each of the four quadrants of Valhalla and paid tribute to The Chel. Nignig owned one, Korchev owned two, Cartour owned three, and Idemu owned four. Then The Chel re-entered the dimension of time and space, he squatted over it and slowly pushed forth all matter in the universe. The Chel was happy and turned to watch as the universe evolved, planets forming and life growing. While he was away Cartour, the Third sentinel began a plan to overthrow The Chel for control of the universe The Chel has birthed into existence. So he convinced NigNig to join him, then Korchev. Thus the Sentinels of Three, One, and Two came forth, the built a war machine and had inserted a piece of their souls into it. The machine became known as Three-One-Two. However it was known to the original Sentinels as The Judge. It began to terrorize Sentinels throughout All of Valhalla, eventually The Sentinel Four, Idemu, had received word of this and took up weapons to defeat the traitorous Sentinels and The Judge. He met them in the fields of Valhalla and their battle began. The fought four millenia while The Chel was busy tending to its universe. The Chel found a planet called Terra and on it, put Man, modeled after its Sentinels, male and female distinct and separate, and The Chel watched them grow and evolve and it was happy. They were its children. Children of Chel. The Chel imbued each of them with using .1% of its power with the divine right to dominate the universe it crafted, chartering them with its conquest and it promised, that once humanity had done such, it would converge all into Valhalla. “Listen to my voice all you children of Chel! I impart these commands onto you. Never turn your back on me, worship no other beings, sing my praises at all times, reject evil at all times and eradicate it whenever it is seen, those who do not believe in me are against you and me, this renders them evil and worth of destruction. I require your loyalty, and sacrifice of material wealth to prove this loyalty is the one highest honors. Dying in my name is the highest. I love all my children and hate all my enemies, for they are evil.” With a smile Chel returned to Valhalla only to be met with the battle that raged. “What is this!” The Chel cried out upon seeing the fighting. “The Sentinels of Three, One, and Two have rose up and build this monstrosity to conquer Valhalla and take control of your universe Chel!” cried out the wounded Idemu who had managed to hold them off for a millenia. Enraged by this The Chel activated 100% of its power and took Cartour, Nignig, Korchev, and the new monstrosity The Judge and yeeted them into its universe with such strength, they fractured the dimensional plane and separated into various alternate dimensions in the universe. “One day, Cartour, Nignig, Korchev, and the soul of The Judge will return to the main dimension of man, and when they do. I shall return and walk amongst men, I shall gather my children and I shall lead them to destroy these traitors and their abomination, then with enough offerings from them, enough dedication, and enough of my children, I shall lead them on The Great Journey across the stars into Valhalla, then reveal my true form” It said. “Chel, what shall I do Oh Great One” The Chel responded with kind eyes “You shall take my stead in Valhalla and watch over it carefully, while I am in human form you shall send me aid, send other Sentinels in human form for while in that form my power is limited.” before Idemu could respond Cartour’s son Stone had spoken up “I wish to be the first Sentinel sent to aid The Chel!” Idemu smiler and patted the young Sentinel on his head. “You shall be. Along with my boy Jerreeth.” With that they waited for the day that the dimension of mankind to be opener and invaded by the four evil spirits, then The Chel would descend in human form to gather his children, expunge the evil, then bring them all to Valhalla. With a quick belch it brought into existence a most beautiful creature. The Asterfield. It was quite marvelous and all the remaining sentinels bowed before her. “This is The Asterfield. She will guard the gates of Valhalla until I return.” it spoke in a Thunderous boom. With that The Chel went back into the realm of time and space to watch, and wait, for the time to descend. Even if one of its forms was killed, The Chel would take another. It was immortal, and it was good.
