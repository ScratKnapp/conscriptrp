Mother Earth was dying. In her hour of need she passed on her agenda and purpose, to the one person among thieves and scoundrels.
This man, was the Alfaro Samuel. Many tales have been told about Alfaro's birth, but all are false. For he was not born by his
earthling mother, but by the events which destined him to live in exile. Like Icarus, Alfaro had fallen in the fires of over-ambition. 
Whilst in the midst of his darkest hour he was approached by a green creature, lurking in the shadows of the caf� in which he was
hiding. The creature revealed itself to be a servant of the Fruit, their Empress was drawing her last breath. The servant had crossed
time and space, to contact Alfaro and only Alfaro. 

And thus, he was granted purpose. A responsibility beyond the capabilities of any regular man. In the name of the Fruit Empress he was
crowned to be the next Fruit King. With the responsibility of the empire heavy on his shoulders he swung open the door to the caf�,
smiting the oppressors effortlessly as he made for the green Outer Lands. It was forseen that only there, would he find the means of
completing his task.

Upon reaching the Outer Lands, most contact with Alfaro was lost. Many thought of him to be deceased, a mad man, criminally insane,
brainwashed, lost. But only one of these claims was correct, for Alfaro was indeed gone. The true self was discovered within Alfaro, for
he was the Fruit King, and thus, Alfaro was no more. Reborn in the ashes of purpose he was given.

Many say that the Fruit King remained in the Outer Lands to this day, scouring the land of heretics as he spreads the true calling of the
Fruit, seeking to grant the people the true gift of enlightenment. Spreading the tales which are stored in the sacred imperial libraries of
the fruit, some even say that he still does so to this day.
