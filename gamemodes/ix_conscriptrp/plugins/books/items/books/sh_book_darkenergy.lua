[Upon opening the book, you see a greyscale picture of a beaming old man with neatly combed hair sitting in front of a Combine logo. From the elated look on his face, it would appear that he is enjoying the prospect of having his picture put on the front page of a book.]

About the Author: Doctor David Crow, PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Edinburgh, is a leading Civil Administrator for the Universal Union. In his pre-war academic career, he wrote several insightful, though sadly under appreciated, papers on the theories of teleportation. Unable to find employment at Black Mesa and having been dismissed from Aperture Science following an unfortunate misunderstanding, Dr Crow was the Professor of Physics at Goldsmith's University in London at the time of the Seven Hour War. Quickly recognising the benevolence of the Union, Dr Crow continued research into teleportation technology. He was appointed to the Civil Administration for City 11 in order to help spread the Union's message and educate the masses.
I have written this book in the hopes of clearing up some misunderstandings that the population have in the matter of Dark Energy and it's uses. I shall attempt to describe, in terms that will be understood by the everyman, the nature of Dark Energy and it's usage by our mutual benefactors.


Dark energy is a form of energy that naturally permeates all space throughout the universe. It is normally unable to be detected by conventional means, and indeed its existence was considered purely theoretical prior to the Resonance Cascade. On large scales, it opposes the force of gravity, causing the universe to expand. It constitutes just over 68% of the energy in the universe, which is even more daunting when taking into consideration the fact that "ordinary matter" doesn't even compose 5%.


The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is simply the "cost of having space": that is, a volume of space has some intrinsic, fundamental energy. This is the cosmological constant, sometimes called Lambda. Since energy and mass are related by Einstein's theory of general relativity, this energy will have a gravitational effect. As such this invisible energy may be related to the zero point energy field, also known as vacuum energy because it is the energy density of empty vacuum; In layman's terms, the underlying background energy that exists in space even when devoid of matter. In fact, most theories of particle physics predict quantum fluctuations in the fabric of space time that would give the vacuum this sort of energy.


The cosmological constant has negative pressure; That is to say that it acts repulsively and in opposition to gravity. The reason why a cosmological constant has negative pressure can be seen from classical thermodynamics; Energy must be lost from inside a container to do work on the container. A change in volume dV requires work done equal to a change of energy -P dV, where P is the pressure. But the amount of energy in a vacuum actually increases when the volume increases (dV is positive), because the energy is equal to pV, where p(rho) is the energy density of the cosmological constant. Therefore, P is negative and, in fact, P = -p.


The English name for this energy stems from the human theories that speculated on the acceleration of the universe and concluded that some invisible but widespread energy had to be responsible; the nature of this energy was unknown and it could not be directly detected - hence the label 'Dark Energy'. 


Much of our mutual benefactors' technology is powered by Dark Energy. Dark Energy reactors actually convert the energy into matter through a process that is impossible to describe with our limited lexis; In basic terms, an anti-mass condenser field converts the Dark Energy into particles of exotic matter, which are emitted from the poles of the sphere as beams of plasma. Dark Energy's negative pressure means that the plasma that results from this conversion is a form of exotic matter that gives off astronomical amounts of energy, so much so that a single Dark Energy Reactor has a higher energy output than all Humanities pre-war power production faculties combined. This exotic high-energy plasma is also sometimes referred to as Dark Energy for the sake of convenience but should not be confused with Dark Energy it's self, which is invisible and typically does not interact with matter. Although the initial start-up process for these reactors requires an immense amount of power, the exotic properties of the Dark Energy plasma amplify the quantum fluctuations and cause a chain reaction within the core that makes the reactor self-sustaining, in turn making dark energy the most efficient form of energy production in human history. These reactors produce the vast majority of Dark Energy Plasma used by the Union.


Dark Energy Reactors are not without their risks, however; The rate of the reaction has to be carefully regulated, as if too much Dark Energy plasma is produced then it will cause more severe quantum fluctuations, exponentially accelerating the reaction process as more and more Dark Energy plasma is reduced, creating more severe fluctuations. The result of this would be a Dark Energy flare and subsequently a resonance cascade, not dissimilar to that produced in the Black Mesa Facility, tearing open dimensional rifts and portals.


Thankfully, our benefactors' safety measures ensure that a Dark Energy flare cannot possibly occur without external intervention and, even if one was to somehow occur, all other reactors on the planet will automatically have a damper placed onto them in order to prevent a chain reaction and thus contain the resonance cascade to a single location and prevent planet wide portal storms.


Although Dark Energy Plasma is created in the reactors of the Union Citadels, this plasma has to be harnessed by various generators in order to produce power. This transfer can be done in the form of glowing beams of plasma on a local scale. Other ways of transferring Dark Energy Plasma is by concentrating it into energy balls. The exotic properties of these balls energy distorts light and gives them a strange, semi-transparent appearance. Beams of Dark Energy can also form cylindrical fields in which gravity is neutralised and from which power can be harnessed. As a result of this diversity, a wide variety of power generators exist.


Among the most common of these are Oscillation Generators. This type of generator contains the energy ball within a force field where it oscillates up and down, the movement of the exotic Dark Energy plasma producing quantum fluctuations that give off a large amount of energy. The energy from these fluctuations is harnessed by the generator and used to power equipment and machinery. The oscillating energy ball dissipates very slowly and therefore one energy ball can drive a generator for a number of days. The generator powers its own containment field on activation; this field is sufficient to keep the energy ball from degrading as it would in normal space and therefore produces an extremely stable and efficient reactor. A compact variation of the oscillation reactor powers larger Union vehicles, and as a result these vehicles can be used to power other devices such as force fields.


Dark Energy Socket generators use energy balls directly as fuel, allowing the exotic matter contained therein to revert to Dark Energy. This produces far more power but it also causes the energy ball to dissipate far more quickly than an oscillation generator. Socket generators are more commonly used in areas where Dark Energy is more readily available or in areas where a far greater level of power is required.


In addition to these methods, Dark Energy plasma can be stored in a Dark Energy core, which acts as a power cell and can be plugged into a device such as a City Scanner or Autonomous Sentry Turret when required. Dark Energy cells are also used in order to power Pulse weaponry such as the Overwatch Standard Issue Pulse Rifle. These Dark Energy plasma rounds are extremely deadly with even near misses causing severe burns. Indeed, contact with Dark Energy plasma in any circumstance is almost invariably lethal as it will boil ones internal organs, causing an excruciating death. Contact with greater quantities of this exotic matter can result in the unlucky individual becoming part of the conversion reaction, cancelling out their mass and subjecting them to molecular disintegration, wholly obliterating them.


It is my hope that this book has been helpful in clearing up any questions that the populace might have in the matter of Dark Energy. Should you have any further questions, I would be happy to answer any questions that are sent to me via letter. I will endeavour to answer all questions to the best of my ability.
