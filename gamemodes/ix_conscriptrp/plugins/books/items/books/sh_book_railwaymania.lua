In the early 19th century, the advent of the Steam Locomotive Engine and successful railway lines caused British Railway Mania to spark up for the first time. Although this stock market bubble ultimately collapsed, the railways remained important to Victorian Britain economically and continued to expand throughout the 20th century with smaller bouts of ‘railway mania’ occurring. As such while they had a lesser but still noteworthy social and cultural effect, their biggest impact was economic as increased infrastructure led to a more connected and efficient national industry.

Pugh provides a clear demonstration of the scale of Britain's railway development when he writes that "With some 6000 miles of railways in 1850, Britain's network had grown to 13000 miles by 1871, and the number of passengers carried rose from 67 million to 322 million."  Certainly, even long after the railway bubble in the early 19th century, the expansion of the railways continued unabated. In fact, by the end of the 19th century there was a staggering 18,665 miles of track and it continued to grow into the early 20th century with another 1300 miles of track lain by 1910.  The phenomenal increase in the number of passengers Pugh gives and the startling speed with which the railway network in Britain more than doubled in size demonstrates that as a result of the development of the Railways, Britain became more connected and travel became more common, much easier and more important to people. It shrunk the world down and allowed for quick movement of goods and people across the nation. 
This was important economically as the interconnectedness of cities and industrial centres across Britain contributed to economic growth throughout the 19th century. Wolmar explains that the railway had contributed to the development of industry in England and argues that the economic importance of the railway was actually underestimated by contemporary government. He believes that "...spending on the railways had far more value to society than the narrow economic returns obtained from the fare box. The Southern had proved this by stimulating growth and development for a swathe of south east England..."  In short, he believes that the true value if the railways isn't in their direct returns or their ability to transport passengers but rather in that they stimulate growth by allowing the transport of goods and resources. He thus argues that the railways were an important force in the economic and industrial development of England even though it seems economically unsound at face value. This would suggest that the railways were much more important economically than they were socially or culturally. As freight was one of the most important sources of income for railway companies and allowed businesses to shift around needed goods on an unprecedented scale. From 1865 to 1910, British railway receipts as a proportion of GDP rose from a total of 4.4% to 6.1% and of this figure, passenger trains rose from 2.0% to 2.8% while freight trains rose from 2.4% to 3.3%.  This clearly shows that a massive amount of goods were being transported around the country by freight train and this transportation alone generated a substantial portion of the British GDP. These freight trains were responsible for the majority of the income for large railway companies.  This large-scale transportation undoubtedly had a knock on effect on industry by allowing faster and more reliable movement of raw materials for industry. This is reflected in the figures as the increasing share of freight trains demonstrate that there was greater need for transport and thus suggesting an increase in goods overall. Furthermore, trade in Britain became intrinsically linked to the railways in a similar manner to which the expansion of the Canals had been tied to industry. As noted by Casson “…roads and canals became feeders to the rail network, so railways - right from the outset - became feeders to the shipping network.”  These railway networks developed alongside canals to become important links in the British trade network, allowing vast quantities of finished goods to be moved to the coast and transported for sale across the globe. This contributed to Britain’s position as the quintessential trading nation of the mid-18th century. In this regard the railway became an economic linchpin for the further development of British industry and trade.
However, some historians disagree that the railway was more economically important than socially or culturally important. Thompson writes that "Symbolically and literally the railway lay somewhere near the centre of that society. Whether the railways did in fact impel the whole economy down the ringing grooves of change is debatable."   Thus, he believes that the railways were important culturally and that although they had an economic impact, they were not particularly a major force in the evolution of the British economy. The Railway became an important cultural symbol of the industrial age and that they were socially important even if they were not economically vital. There is some evidence to support this; during railway mania money was poured into railway lines that had poor economic prospects, creating a bubble that burst and bankrupting many investors and yet despite this economic failure, the railway remained a prominent icon and was oft celebrated. Although some certainly opposed the vast tracks of railways being lain in the country, with some viewing it as destroying the countryside or as being an affront against God and nature, many viewed it as a sign of progress. Furthermore, although the early railway mania was ill-conceived and ultimately ended in disaster, the railways continued to grow throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century with the largest British companies being railway companies. 
Indeed, John Mullan notes that over the course of the 19th century, the theme of the railway began to appear in Victorian literature, having captured the perception of the public to an extent. He uses the example of Charles Dickens novel Dombey And Son, where "The railway is irresistible, first destroying, and then bringing ‘throbbing currents’ of new vitality..."  According to John Mullan, trains and the railway came to represent destiny, progress and advancement. Given the nature of railway travel, perhaps it was inevitable that they would come to be associated with inevitability and fate as the passengers have a fixed path with no deviation and as such the presence of trains in literature as a metaphor for fate is understandable. Of greater note, would be their association with, as Mullan puts it, ‘new vitality’. The use of the railways in this manner suggests that writers saw the railways as imbuing the country with life and propelling progress. While this portrayal and metaphor in Victorian literature is important as it will, to an extent, represent the views of society, it is important to note that the ‘new vitality’ of the railways also extends to economic vitality and growth and not just as being one related to travel. Dickens himself, while ambivalent in some ways towards the railway, still wrote about the good it had brought to some and its economic potential in Dombey and Son  To Victorian writers, the railway became an important social, cultural and economic symbol and began to appear more and more as metaphor. It should be noted that there were negative metaphors along with the positive ones of progress and advancement. Freeman writes that many “were doing nothing more than echoing deeply seated contemporary emotions when they attached to the railway images of hell.”  Some went as far as to decry the trains as supernatural or demonic, ascribing them such qualities as being favoured by the devil.  However, these voices were drowned out by the more positive voices and by the sheer economic benefits the railways brought to Victorian Britain.
The argument that the railways became an important cultural symbol to the British public is also presented by Garside, who writes that “the railways were the archetypal symbol of the Victorian age, combining images of progress and advancing civilization with the destruction of peace and beauty” . Again, while some Victorians did indeed comment on the destruction of the English countryside that resulted from the railways, many viewed them as a symbol of advancement and technological ingenuity. Garside also notes, however, that it is impossible to ignore the economic importance of the railway and that this is perhaps more important than its cultural impact. 
Paul Atterbury also argues that the railway had an important impact on Victorian society as "The railways, offering as they did new opportunities for travel and commerce, and breaking down social barriers in the process, were immediately popular... encouraged by acts of parliament that ensured that trains conformed to standards of speed and comfort and offered rates that were affordable by all."  By making affordable tickets available to all, class barriers on movement were somewhat eased. Whereas a poor man would previously have had little choice but to reside within one area for his entire life, he was now able to travel across the country. Some might argue that this caused it to be seen as a symbol of freedom and liberation or that it contributed to the erosion of social class in Britain. However, this ignores that the conditions of rail travel were initially poor and the safety standards were also poor. While it is true that, under government mandate, railway companies had to provide cheap and affordable tickets to the common people, these lacked some important facilities such as lavatories until the latter half of the century. 
In addition, some criticise this viewpoint and believe that the railway was not a very important social or cultural icon at the time. Odlyzko argues that "Overall, there was not all that much excitement about railways, other than accidents, which newspapers devoted a lot of space to, especially where death or serious injury was involved."  He believes that the public was not heavily invested or interested in the railways and that Railway Mania was thus restricted primarily to the capitalists and industrialists while most of the county was not behind the railways at all. In this case, one can argue that the railways impact was mostly economic rather than social and that historians have overestimated its cultural impact.
In terms of the cultural impact, one should not ignore that Victorian Britain was very concerned with its prestige and anxious to be seen as modern and industrial. Paul Atterbury notes that "As the railway was, in essence, a British creation, it was readily exported to many parts of the world, as a concept, and in component form. British engineers, British construction teams and British capital built railways throughout the Empire, in the Americas and in many parts of Europe"  This made it a boon to British prestige throughout the world as many countries hired British engineers in order to build railways and expand their own industries. As such the railway became associated with Britain and was a sign of progress, development and British ingenuity. As a technology and idea, it became a prestigious and economically important British export, a revolutionary design that soon began to spread across the world due to the hiring of British engineers and the investment of British investors in foreign countries. In some cases such as in Argentina, these railways remained primarily British owned into the early 20th century . To this day, the railway remains an important and expanding part of the worlds transport and trade network.
