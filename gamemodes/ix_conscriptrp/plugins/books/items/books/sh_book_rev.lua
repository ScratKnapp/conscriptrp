The word for Revolution in my language, is practically the same as in yours, but that cannot be said of all your intercontinental
allies in your city. If you are reading this book, you're either a loyalist, currently treading thin ice, or an aspiring member of
the rebellion, in which case I wish you all the luck of the world. In this book, I aim to teach you as quickly and efficiently as I
can, how to get yourself to us with the best chances of surviving. One last thing, throw this book away when you're done. It's likely
to be quite controversial.

Behaving. I know you're unhappy. I know what they took from you, believe me, I do, but you must bide your time. Do not lash out. When
you are dead, you can no longer fight back. When you are weak, you can no longer run. Keep a low profile and play nice. Assist CPs.
Pick up that can. Then, only when you are fit enough, ready enough, and have enough supplies to benefit us, should you consider making
the dive into the rebellion head first. Keep your head down, and your eyes ahead.

Collecting. Hoard everything. Suitcases, cans, tokens, food, drinks, medical supplies, anything. We need it all. We don't get rations down
here. I have to hand it to those Union Bastards, they fed us at least. I recommend having a large lump of supplies, as well as food and
drink, warm clothes, and a hefty pocket of tokens. Two or three thousand should do it. Enough to get you armed. So. You've done all that,
got all your supplies, now what? Find us.

This chapter is going to be really, really brief. If you're reading this, you probably already know how to find us. Keep asking. Your efforts
will pay off eventually. Drop us whatever food and drink you can spare until then. It all helps. Just don't expect getting down to be quick
or easy, and never forget; your life is on the line. So you're one of us now. How do you stay that way, alive, for the most part.

Thriving. The most important thing about staying alive, is making sure you have friends, not enemies. Make allies and connections, and don't
allow bad blood to flow. It will end in your death. Nobody will come to save you in the sewers or outlands. Make sure you're not alone. Find
work. Some rebels need jobs doing. You could even consider joining the black market. Risky, but profitable. Either way, it's down to you.
Whatever you do, don't end up as another shambling corpse in the Sewers. I look forward to meeting you.
