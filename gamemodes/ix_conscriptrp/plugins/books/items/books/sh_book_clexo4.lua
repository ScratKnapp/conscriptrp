Oh dear... I shouldn't be writing this... They'll find out I just know it!

I have come too far to go back now. I am currently writing this from City 17, if you find this book, you're lucky.
Today I will tell you about the cult... you know which one... The way they act... What they are- WHO they are.

I managed to find out who these people are, I saw many things. One pale looking male coaxed me into the sewers, wanting to show me something. He brought me to a room with a single box like podium with a lamp placed on top of it;
at the time, I didn't know anything about a cult, let alone a lamp cult, so this didn't set off any alarm bells in my head. There was another door in said room where three other figures dressed in long black robes
with a hood along with a gas mask, masking the three's identities.
I asked what all of this was, they didn't reply. Shortly after, the male who brought me here walked into the room that the three figures emerged from, leaving me here with these masked men.
One of them, seemingly a more trusted member, approached the podium where the lamp rested upon. He... well I assume it was a he, opened a grey book and began reading from it.
At this point I was not following what he was reading, I was still in shock about the whole situation. I managed to listen lightly, hearing about 'The great one' and 'Nlaw them', whatever all that nonsense means.

After he was done reading the book, he placed it down with the lamp before walking off to join the other two.
The male who brought me here came back out of the room, now dressed in the same robes and gas mask the three were wearing, he bowed before the lamp, walking closer to it. The lamp seemed to let out a deep 'hum' of sorts.
The male nodded, almost as if the lamp was speaking to him, he let out a deep hum in rhythm of the lamp's humming.
I wanted out of this craziness, I said nothing, walking to the door to exit.
As soon as I reached for the door, one of the cloaked crazies yelled at the top of his lungs, beckoning me to stay. I did not, I ran very far away back to the City.

As I ran, I swear I could hear the sound of metallic scraping mixed with an electrical pulse of some sorts..?
Anyway, I ran all the way back to the City and into my store. I presumed my husband John was in the back room again, as always...
I rush into the back room, yelling for John. He was on the floor... dead... Oh God... a knife right through his chest. A crudely drawn lamp was displayed on the wall accompanied with a picture... Hands shaking I observed said picture... 
I attached the picture below... I don't know what this means or what this is, it has to be something to do with the cult...
