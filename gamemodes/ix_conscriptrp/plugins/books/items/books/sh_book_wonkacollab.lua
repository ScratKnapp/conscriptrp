“Collaboration, the will to push one’s or many agenda further to fulfill a goal. That is, collaboration. Collaboration is beneficial, is crucial for progression to complete a goal, for teamwork is the greatest asset and ability of oneself to possess! Collaboration is nothing to be ashamed of, as many see it to be. People fear collaboration, for in the end, they are blinded by the potential and oblivious to its goal, thinking only of what evil it can do and its repercussions, not of its purpose to benefit the people, or humanity as a whole in it’s progression.

Some have feared collaboration with our benefactors for they fear the unknown, they fear what collaboration can create, can form. They only fear what’d be the end result. Many seek not to collaborate with our benefactors, for they fear the unknown. When people think of our benefactors, they think of it’s foreign, extra-terrestrial nature. They think of the horrors they can commit, fear its powers, its potential over its intentions. If our benefactors weren’t to save us from our collapsing world, riddled by conflict, invasive creatures and death, then where would we be? Our benefactors have thought to save humanity from itself, they wish to advance our species to the cosmos but we ourselves, with our superstition and fear of the unknown hinder their efforts!

Without collaboration, there is no society, there is no humanity. For collaboration is what pushed humanity out of its cradle, encouraged it to build its society from the ground up. Collaboration is what encouraged humanity to reach to the stars, and we all but nearly lost it on that fateful day when our governments collapsed, our people became desperate and with it, our society was gone.

Collaboration is teamwork. To be a collaborator of our benefactors is to be a collaborator of humanity, for without collaboration, there is no progression.”
